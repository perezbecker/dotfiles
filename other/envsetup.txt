    Note that the following lines need to be added to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (adding to .profile made it crash)
    setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'
    xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'
    Cretate directory ~/dotfiles/vim/bundle
(6) Clone Vundle.vim (Vim bundle manager) into directory ~/dotfiles/vim/bundle by running "git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git" 
(7) Install all plugins handled by Vundle by running :PluginInstall inside a vim session.
(8) Softlink vid command to ~/bin/
